Simple terminal program that applies an insecure Vigenère cipher on STDIN and send results to STDOUT

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher][Vigenère cipher]]

* How to build
Run the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd Release
make all && make test
#+END_SRC

This will create a program called vigcipher and execute test.sh in the scripts directory.
If all the tests pass, you should be good to go.  A good start would be to read the help by running:
#+BEGIN_SRC
./vigcipher --help
#+END_SRC
